# GA-Project-1-Sat-Scores

Files:

1) sat_scores.csv - original file of SAT scores from 2001 (mean scores and participation rate for year 2001 by State).

2) sat_scores_test.csv - altered CSV file substituting NE in for NB so that Nebraska data could be read by Tableau for heat maps. Created with csv writer.

3) Tableau workbook - contains heat maps of Participation Rate and Scores for the U.S.

4) SAT scores data Ameet.ipynb - code and output for the Project. Includes plots.

5) sat_scores_clean.csv - CSV created with numpy savetxt, which eliminated the column name references and hence was not of much use for Tableau heat maps. Did not use.
